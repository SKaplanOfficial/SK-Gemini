Hello, I'm Stephen Kaplan. I'm an open-source software developer focused on workflow automation, desktop applications, and web development. I actively maintain several projects, including several Python packages, a list of macOS automation resources, various Raycast extensions</a>, and more. Some projects I've contributed to include rumps, a Python package for creating macOS menu-bar apps, and the Raycast Utils package for Node.js. I've also created and published a few node packages myself, and I'm currently working on a few more. In my spare time, I'm developing a few AppleScript libraries called ImageLib, PDFLib, and WebLib. I also have a YouTube channel (@helloimsteven3103) where I post videos showcasing my projects, and I'm hoping to expand it to include tutorials and other content in the future.

Here are some links to my projects and profiles:3
