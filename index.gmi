## Introduction

Hello, I'm Stephen Kaplan. I'm an open-source software developer focused on workflow automation, desktop applications, and web development. I actively maintain several projects, including several Python packages, a list of macOS automation resources, various Raycast extensions</a>, and more. Some projects I've contributed to include rumps, a Python package for creating macOS menu-bar apps, and the Raycast Utils package for Node.js. I've also created and published a few node packages myself, and I'm currently working on a few more. In my spare time, I'm developing a few AppleScript libraries called ImageLib, PDFLib, and WebLib. I also have a YouTube channel (@helloimsteven3103) where I post videos showcasing my projects, and I'm hoping to expand it to include tutorials and other content in the future.

## My projects

### Python Packages

* A Python package for manipulating images using Objective-C frameworks.

### Raycast Extensions

=> projects/image-modification/index.gmi	Image Modification

=> projects/pins/index.gmi	Pins

* Raycast extension for pinning links, files, folders, apps, scripts, and more to the macOS menu bar.

=> projects/promptlab/index.gmi	PromptLab

* Raycast extension for creating and sharing powerful, contextually-aware AI commands using placeholders, action scripts, and more.
